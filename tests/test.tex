\section{Introduction}

This is a test. It contains two paragraphs. This is the first one.

This is the second one, with only one sentence and followed by a bulleted list of three fruits:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Banana
 \item Apple
 \item Pear
\end{itemize}

We can \emph{emphasise} words like this.

\section{Conclusion}

That's all for now!
